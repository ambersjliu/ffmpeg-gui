## Principles of Universal Design
### Principle 1: Equitable Use

1. Since all the text in the views are located in their respective view models, we can easily implement a translated version of the app.
2. The app runs on Windows, MacOS and Linux

### Principle 2: Flexibility in Use

1. The app can be used with almost any media format
2. The user can choose to just convert a file or also perform basic editing operations.

### Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use

1. User Interface contains clearly labelled buttons and labels.
2. The pre-filled values in the Textfield within the conversion views are the attributes of the original media by default.

### Principle 4: Perceptible Information

1. The success / failure messages are clearly labelled in green / red respectively.
2. In the future, we can add an option to change the font size.

### Principle 5: Tolerance for Error

1. The application won't overwrite the original file.
2. We also have various mechanisms to prevent invalid input, which are under the validator.

### Principle 6: Low Physical Effort

1. Most fields on the conversion view are pre-filled so that the user does not need to type them in by hand. But if the user wants to change certain parameters, or
 in case the selected file is missing this information, the user will have to spend effort filling them in. In the future, we would
like to add support for voice navigation and data entry.
2. The application does not show image icons or previews of the currently selected file, so the user may have to navigate between the application
and their original media file. We would like to add a visual preview of video files so that the user
does not need to switch tabs while using the application.
3. The also does not require the user to have quick reflexes.

### Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use

1. The app itself is only 10MB, which is comparatively small.
2. The window size of the app is adequate. We would like to make the application responsive to different display sizes in the future.

## Marketing Strategy

1. Students who may need to submit video assignments or recordings. They may need to reduce the file size of videos in order to email or submit it.
2. Corporate art designers / content creators who may need to convert video and audio assets but want to avoid the security risk of using online tools for conversion.

## Tendency of usage by different demographics

1. It will be less likely to be used by people who are less technically literate, especially the elderly, who have a higher chance of not having knowledge of various media specifications.
2. It will be less likely to be used by people who have visual disabilities as the app doesn't support screen readers currently.
