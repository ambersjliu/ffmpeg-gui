## Summary
FFmpeg For Regular People is a easy-to-use
interface for converting video and audio files. 

As indicated by the name, it uses [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html) to make media conversion possible. FFmpeg is a free and open-source software suite that can read, encode, filter, and transcode
almost every media format in use today.

This project was made possible by the [ffmpeg-cli-wrapper](https://github.com/bramp/ffmpeg-cli-wrapper) library.

### Motivation
FFmpeg comes with a powerful CLI, but many beginner users
find it difficult to understand the documentation, navigate the terminal, and learn the commands. This results
in people resorting to alternative optionsâ€”often using shady websites that promise
to convert files, but frequently show obtrusive ads and malicious download links. 

Our goal with FFmpeg For Regular People was to create a tool that makes it easier
for the average person to leverage the speed and power of the FFmpeg CLI, while also offering
while offering enough flexibility to also satisfy more experienced users.

### Supported Inputs:
- Most video/audio formats & codecs currently supported by FFmpeg ([list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg#Supported_codecs_and_formats))
- We currently only support videos with single audio streams. We aim to support videos with multiple audio streams in the near future.
### Supported Outputs:
#### Formats: 
- Conversion to the following video formats:
  - mp4, mov, avi, webm, mpeg, m4v, gif
- Conversion to the following audio formats:
  - mp3, flac, alac, wav, ogg
#### Codecs:
- Encoding with the following video codecs:
  - av1, h264, hevc, mpeg1video, mpeg2video, mpeg4, vp9
- Encoding with the following audio codecs:
  - mp3, flac, opus, aac, alac, wavpack, tta, wmalossless, tak, mp4als

We aim to provide a minimally opinionated conversion scheme. However, certain format/codec combinations
are incompatible and may not work. (For example, the "opus" audio codec supports a fixed sample rate of 48kHz.)
