## Summary
FFmpeg For Regular People is a easy-to-use
interface for converting video and audio files. 

As indicated by the name, it uses FFmpeg to make media conversion possible. FFmpeg is a free and open-source software suite that can read, encode, filter, and transcode
almost every media format in use today.

### Motivation
FFmpeg comes with a powerful CLI, but many beginner users
find it difficult to understand the documentation, navigate the terminal, and learn the commands. This results
in people resorting to alternative optionsâ€”often using shady websites that promise
to convert files, but frequently show obtrusive ads and malicious download links. 

Our goal with FFmpeg For Regular People was to create a tool that makes it easier
for the average person to leverage the speed and power of the FFmpeg CLI, while also offering
while offering enough flexibility to also satisfy more experienced users.
