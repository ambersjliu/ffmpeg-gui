## Summary
FFmpeg For Regular People is a easy-to-use
interface for converting video and audio files. 

As indicated by the name, it uses [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html) to make media conversion possible. FFmpeg is a free and open-source software suite that can read, encode, filter, and transcode
almost every media format in use today.

This project was made possible by the [ffmpeg-cli-wrapper](https://github.com/bramp/ffmpeg-cli-wrapper) library.

### Motivation
FFmpeg comes with a powerful CLI, but many beginner users
find it difficult to understand the documentation, navigate the terminal, and learn the commands. This results
in people resorting to alternative optionsâ€”often using shady websites that promise
to convert files, but frequently show obtrusive ads and malicious download links. 

Our goal with FFmpeg For Regular People was to create a tool that makes it easier
for the average person to leverage the speed and power of the FFmpeg CLI, while also offering
while offering enough flexibility to also satisfy more experienced users.

## Features
### Supported inputs:
- Most video/audio formats & codecs currently supported by FFmpeg ([list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg#Supported_codecs_and_formats))
- We currently only support videos with single audio streams. We aim to support videos with multiple audio streams in the near future.
### Supported outputs:
#### Formats:
- Conversion to the following video formats:
  - mp4, mov, avi, webm, mpeg, m4v, gif
- Conversion to the following audio formats:
  - mp3, flac, alac, wav, ogg
#### Codecs:
- Encoding with the following video codecs:
  - av1, h264, hevc, mpeg1video, mpeg2video, mpeg4, vp9
- Encoding with the following audio codecs:
  - mp3, flac, opus, aac, alac, wavpack, tta, wmalossless, tak, mp4als

### Supported operations

This application supports a variety of media operations, including:
- Transcoding
- Trimming
- Resizing (video)
- Cropping (video)
- Change framerate (video)
- High-quality GIF conversion (video)

We aim to provide a minimally opinionated conversion scheme. However, certain parameter combinations
are incompatible and may not work. (For example, the "opus" audio codec supports a fixed sample rate of 48kHz.)

We hope to support more features in the future, including subtitles, chapters, and more advanced video filters.






## Installation instructions


### Dependencies
You will need Java to run this application. You can do so [here.](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/downloads/)

Please follow the appropriate tutorial to add Java to your system path: [Windows and Linux](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-set-java-path-in-windows-and-linux/), [MacOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQk9O03cukQ)

This application also requires you to install FFmpeg.
You can do so [here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html). Please keep note of the installation location. We
recommend you put it in your home directory.

Installing FFmpeg is slightly different for Mac users. Please follow this tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmrjRqEIgGc).

### Installing the application
To install the application, download your preferred release from the [Releases](https://github.com/ambersjliu/ffmpeg-gui/releases) page.
Alternatively, you can download the source code and manually build the application.

### Running the application
To run the application, double-click the downloaded .jar file. If that doesn't work, open the command line and type  `java -jar (path to the jar file)`, replacing the last part with
the path to your jar file (no parentheses). If Java can't be found on the system, please repeat the installation process and make sure
it was added to your system path.

This application has been tested to work on 64-bit Windows and MacOS. It has not been tested on Linux yet.



## Usage guide
You are required to input the path to FFmpeg and FFprobe into the app. Most of the time, FFmpeg and FFprobe will be installed in the same directory.
Input both paths using the "Browse" button.

After entering both paths and pressing "Next", you will be able to input the file you wish to convert.
Import your file by pressing "Browse", selecting it in the dialog, and pressing "Next".
